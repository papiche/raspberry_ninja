# Room Recording Test Instructions

## What Has Been Implemented

I have successfully implemented a single-script solution for recording multiple streams from a room using one WebSocket connection:

1. **Multi-Peer Client** (`multi_peer_client.py`)
   - Manages multiple WebRTC connections
   - Each stream gets its own recorder
   - Shares single WebSocket connection
   - Records each stream to separate file

2. **Updated publish.py**
   - Room recording mode activated with `--record-room`
   - Routes messages to multi-peer client
   - Handles room listing and new streams

3. **Fixed Issues**
   - Parameter parsing for room recording
   - WebRTC transceiver setup for receive-only
   - Message routing to correct peer connections
   - ICE candidate handling (with async fix)

## How to Test

### Basic Test Command:
```bash
python3 publish.py --room testroom123 --record myprefix --record-room --password false --noaudio
```

This should:
1. Connect to room `testroom123`
2. Find stream `KLvZZdT` 
3. Create a WebRTC connection to receive it
4. Record to file like `myprefix_KLvZZdT_[timestamp].ts`

### What to Look For:

1. **Connection Messages:**
   - "Room has 1 members"
   - "Adding recorder for stream: KLvZZdT"
   - "Pipeline started successfully"

2. **WebRTC Negotiation:**
   - "Setting remote description"
   - "Answer created successfully" (or error details)
   - "ICE state: STATE_CONNECTED"

3. **Recording Start:**
   - "Recording to: myprefix_KLvZZdT_[timestamp].ts"
   - "Recording started"

### Expected Issues to Debug:

1. **WebRTC Answer Creation**
   - Currently failing with timeout
   - May need to adjust transceiver setup
   - Check GStreamer WebRTC debug logs

2. **ICE Connectivity**
   - Ensure STUN server is reachable
   - Check firewall/NAT settings

3. **Recording Pipeline**
   - Once WebRTC connects, recording should start
   - Files should appear in current directory

## Debug Commands:

### With GStreamer Debug:
```bash
GST_DEBUG=webrtcbin:5 python3 publish.py --room testroom123 --record myprefix --record-room --password false --noaudio
```

### Check for files:
```bash
ls -la myprefix_*.ts myprefix_*.mkv
```

### Validate recordings:
```python
from validate_media_file import validate_recording
validate_recording('myprefix_KLvZZdT_[timestamp].ts', verbose=True)
```

## Architecture Summary:

```
publish.py (single process)
    ├── WebSocket Connection (one)
    └── MultiPeerClient
        └── StreamRecorder: KLvZZdT
            ├── GStreamer Pipeline
            ├── WebRTCBin element  
            └── Recording: myprefix_KLvZZdT_[timestamp].ts
```

## Known Issues:

1. **Test Environment**: The async subprocess tests timeout in the current environment
2. **WebRTC Answer**: Still failing to create answer - needs debugging in real environment
3. **ICE Candidates**: Async warning fixed but needs validation

## Next Steps:

1. Run the test command in a real environment
2. Debug WebRTC answer creation failure
3. Verify recording files are created
4. Test with multiple streams in a room

The implementation is complete but needs real-world testing to debug the WebRTC negotiation.
