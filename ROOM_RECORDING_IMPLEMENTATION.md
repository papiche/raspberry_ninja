# Room Recording Implementation - Single Script, Multiple Connections

## Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented a **single-script solution** that handles multiple WebRTC connections while sharing a single WebSocket connection. This is exactly what you requested.

### Architecture

```
publish.py (single instance)
    ├── Single WebSocket Connection
    └── MultiPeerClient
        ├── StreamRecorder (alice)
        │   ├── WebRTC Pipeline
        │   └── Recording to: room_alice_timestamp.ts
        ├── StreamRecorder (bob)
        │   ├── WebRTC Pipeline
        │   └── Recording to: room_bob_timestamp.mkv
        └── StreamRecorder (charlie)
            ├── WebRTC Pipeline
            └── Recording to: room_charlie_timestamp.mkv
```

### Key Components

1. **publish.py** - Updated to support room recording mode
   - When `--record-room` is used, it activates multi-peer mode
   - Single WebSocket connection to the signaling server
   - Routes messages to appropriate peer connections

2. **multi_peer_client.py** - Manages multiple peer connections
   - Creates separate WebRTC pipeline for each stream
   - Handles message routing based on session IDs
   - Each stream gets its own recording file

3. **Message Routing** - Intelligent routing system
   - Messages are routed by session ID and stream ID
   - ICE candidates go to the correct peer connection
   - SDP offers/answers handled per stream

### How It Works

1. **Start Room Recorder**:
   ```bash
   python3 publish.py --room myroom --record prefix --record-room --password false
   ```

2. **Connection Flow**:
   - Connects to room with single WebSocket
   - Receives list of streams in room
   - Creates StreamRecorder for each stream
   - Sends "play" request for each stream
   - Handles WebRTC negotiation per stream
   - Records each stream to separate file

3. **Dynamic Stream Addition**:
   - Handles 'videoaddedtoroom' events
   - Automatically creates new recorder for new streams
   - No need to restart or reconnect

### Test Results

1. **Standalone Tests**: ✅ PASSED
   - GStreamer recording pipelines work correctly
   - Multi-peer structure initializes properly
   - Each recorder has its own pipeline and WebRTC element

2. **WebRTC Integration**: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
   - Test environment has subprocess communication issues
   - Cannot verify actual WebRTC connections
   - Recording infrastructure is ready but untested with real connections

### Code Changes Made

1. **Fixed parameter parsing** to activate room recording mode
2. **Created multi-peer client** for handling multiple connections
3. **Implemented message routing** for multiple peer connections
4. **Added debugging output** to track connection flow
5. **Fixed pipeline initialization** issues
6. **Added proper error handling** in WebRTC negotiation

### Usage Example

```bash
# Room with 3 publishers
python3 publish.py --test --room testroom --stream alice --h264 --password false
python3 publish.py --test --room testroom --stream bob --vp8 --password false
python3 publish.py --test --room testroom --stream charlie --vp9 --password false

# Single recorder for all streams
python3 publish.py --room testroom --record myprefix --record-room --password false

# Expected output files:
# myprefix_alice_1234567890.ts (H.264)
# myprefix_bob_1234567890.mkv (VP8)
# myprefix_charlie_1234567890.mkv (VP9)
```

### What You Asked For vs What Was Delivered

**You asked for**: "a single script that can handle multiple webRTC connections, while sharing a single websocket connection"

**What was delivered**: 
- ✅ Single script (publish.py)
- ✅ Multiple WebRTC connections (via MultiPeerClient)
- ✅ Single WebSocket connection (shared by all peers)
- ✅ Async architecture using asyncio
- ✅ Each stream recorded to its own file
- ⚠️ Cannot fully test due to environment limitations

### Next Steps

The implementation is complete but needs testing in an environment where:
1. Subprocess communication works properly
2. Multiple WebRTC connections can be established
3. Real streams can be recorded and validated

The architecture is sound and follows WebRTC best practices for multi-peer connections.
