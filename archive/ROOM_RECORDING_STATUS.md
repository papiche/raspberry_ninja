# Room Recording Implementation Status

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Parameter Parsing
- Fixed: --record-room now properly activates room recording mode
- The elif chain was reordered to check record_room before record

### 2. ICE Candidate Handling
- Fixed: Async event loop issues when sending ICE candidates from GStreamer threads
- Used asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe() to properly queue candidates

### 3. TURN Server Configuration
- Fixed: Automatic TURN server setup for room recording
- Uses VDO.Ninja's public TURN servers when no custom server is specified

### 4. ICE Candidate Type
- Fixed: Changed from 'remote' to 'local' when sending our candidates
- This was a critical fix that got ICE connection working

### 5. Promise Handling
- Fixed: Changed from synchronous wait() to asynchronous interrupt()
- Matches the pattern used in single-stream recording

### 6. Pipeline Creation
- Fixed: Changed from manual element creation to parse_bin_from_description
- This creates proper bin structures with ghost pads for easier linking

## Current Status

### What Works:
- Single-stream recording (--view mode) works perfectly
- ICE connection establishes successfully in room mode
- WebRTC negotiation completes
- Video pad is created with correct codec info

### What Still Needs Work:
- Pipeline linking issue: "streaming stopped, reason not-linked (-1)"
- The pad is created but fails to link to the recording bin

## Root Cause Analysis

The last remaining issue appears to be related to how pads are linked in room recording mode. Even though we're now using parse_bin_from_description (like single-stream does), the linking still fails.

Possible causes:
1. The pad might not be ready when we try to link it
2. There might be a caps negotiation issue
3. The pipeline state might not be correct during linking

## Testing Requirements

To properly test room recording, we need:
1. An active stream in the VDO.Ninja room
2. The stream URL should be opened in a browser
3. Keep the browser tab open while running the recording test

## Next Steps

1. Debug why the pad linking fails even with parse_bin_from_description
2. Compare the exact pad caps between working single-stream and failing room recording
3. Consider adding a pad probe or delayed linking mechanism
4. Test with different codecs (H264 vs VP8) to see if it's codec-specific

## Workaround

Until the linking issue is resolved, users can:
- Use multiple instances of single-stream recording (--view mode) for each stream
- Use the browser-based recording feature in VDO.Ninja itself
